export const jacquesArchambaultStory = "Jacques Archambault, born around 1604 in Dompierre-en-Aunis, France, married Françoise Tourault circa 1629, raising seven children amid Huguenot-Catholic conflicts before emigrating to New France in 1645-1646 as a winegrower turned master carpenter and pioneering well digger—constructing Montreal's first public well in 1658 and participating in North America's earliest health insurance scheme. A resilient settler granted land in Sillery and Montreal, he endured Iroquois threats, losing son Denys heroically in 1651, but founded a vast lineage through six surviving children who became farmers, bakers, and nuns. All Archambaults (and descendants) now living in North America trace to him, as no other Archambault emigrated from France. He died February 15, 1688, at 83 in Rivière-des-Prairies, leaving a legacy honored by modern associations and monuments.";
