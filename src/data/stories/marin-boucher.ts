export const marinBoucherStory = "Marin Boucher, a skilled stonemason and carpenter from Perche, France, migrated to New France in 1634 as a key pioneer in the Percheron movement, bringing his family and establishing roots along the St. Lawrence River. As an early settler, he farmed Jesuit lands, inherited Samuel de Champlain's clothing in a contested will, and raised a large family across two marriages, with his children helping found prominent Canadian lines like Plante, Houde, and Godin. One of French Canada's most prolific ancestors, Marin has up to 350,000 descendants across North America, spawning numerous surnames, before his death in 1671 at Ch√¢teau-Richer.";
