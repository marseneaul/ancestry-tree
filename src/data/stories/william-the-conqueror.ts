export const williamTheConquerorStory = "William the Conqueror, born around 1028 in Falaise, Normandy, as the illegitimate son of Duke Robert I, overcame early threats to secure his duchy by 1035 amid rebellions and invasions, forging a powerful Norman state through strategic marriages and military prowess. In 1066, claiming the English throne promised by Edward the Confessor, he invaded England, decisively defeating King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings and being crowned on Christmas Day, ushering in Norman rule with sweeping reforms like the Domesday Book survey of 1086. A ruthless yet innovative ruler who built iconic castles and blended feudal systems, he died September 9, 1087, in Rouen from injuries sustained in battle, profoundly shaping medieval England and Europe's history.";
