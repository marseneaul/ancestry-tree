 export const zacharieClourierStory = "Zacharie Cloutier, born around 1590 in Mortagne-au-Perche, France, became a pioneering carpenter in New France after immigrating in 1634 amid the Percheron wave, settling in Beauport where he built Robert Giffard's manor and resisted feudal homage, sparking early colonial disputes. Married to Xainte Dupont in 1616, he fathered six surviving children who founded one of Quebec's foremost families—all North American Cloutiers descend from him, with descendants including Celine Dion, Madonna, Justin Bieber, Jim Carrey, Chris Pratt, Ricky Gervais, Angelina Jolie, and Justin Trudeau. He died September 17, 1677, in Château-Richer at 87, honored by monuments and even a namesake artisanal cheese for his enduring legacy.";
