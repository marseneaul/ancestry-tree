export const jacobFranksStory = "Jacob Franks, born May 27, 1743, in Alsace-Lorraine, Germany (now France), immigrated to Baltimore, MD, at 18 with father Michael Sr., served an apprenticeship as a silversmith, married Barbara Brandenburg in 1764, and acquired a vast tract near High House, PA, known as 'Frankston' amid rich limestone hills once guided to by friendly Indians. A devout Lutheran, he co-founded St. Jacob's 'Old Dutch Church' in 1785 by donating land and building a log meeting-house with his brother Michael, where sermons were in German, making it one of the earliest west of the Appalachians. He died in 1802, fathering a large family whose descendants scattered across Western states and West Virginia, with annual reunions in Ohio.";
