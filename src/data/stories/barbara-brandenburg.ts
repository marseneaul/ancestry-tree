export const barbaraBrandenburgStory = "Barbara Brandenburg Franks, born 1741 in Germany, immigrated to America in 1775 amid poverty, serving harshly as an indentured servant in Maryland to pay passage before marrying Jacob Franks in 1764 and pioneering in Western Pennsylvania's wilderness, where she birthed daughter Elizabeth in the Chestnut Ridge Mountains during a rugged trading trip. Renowned as the 'sweet singer of the wilderness' for her voice that drew German settlers to Sunday gatherings, this small, dainty woman with a glad heart never took medicine and lived to 98, mothering 7 children and boasting 460 descendants by her 1839 death. A devout German Presbyterian for over 60 years, she's featured in 'The Planting of Civilization in Western Pennsylvania' and buried at Jacob's Evangelical Lutheran Cemetery, land donated by her husband.";
