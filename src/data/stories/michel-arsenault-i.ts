export const michelArsenaultIStory = "Michel Arsenault I, born December 24, 1666, in Cap-de-la-Madeleine, New France—tragically causing his mother Suzanne Lecomte's death in childbirth—became an orphan at age 2 after father François's 1669 passing, growing up under guardianship amid the colony's hardships. He married Marie Madeleine Leblanc Labrie in 1689, fathering at least one son before her death, then wed Catherine Lepere in 1707 in Quebec, continuing his life as a settler in the Trois-Rivières region. He died at 64 on May 12, 1731, in Bécancour, as the pivotal second-generation link in Quebec's Arsenault lineage.";
