A prominent local businessman, he fathered several children including daughter Mary Victoria, and his 1880 will—probated in Franklin County despite transcription noting Montgomery—distributed assets to widow Barbara and heirs like Catherine, Andrew, and Joseph. He died December 1, 1880, in Columbus at age 52, embodying Bavarian immigrant success in America's industrial heartland.";
