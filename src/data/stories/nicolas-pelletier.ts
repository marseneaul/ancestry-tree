export const nicolasPelletierStory = "Nicolas Peltier, baptized June 4, 1596, in Gallardon, Beauce, France, apprenticed as a carpenter at 15 before marrying Jeanne Devoisy around 1632 and migrating to New France circa 1636 as the colony's first Pelletier family—the ancestor of many Métis lines amid high-demand skills for building Québec's Habitation, church roofs, and Château Saint-Louis. Granted 50 arpents in Sillery in 1645, he navigated frontier perils like Iroquois threats and a 1647 brandy-trading fine on Jeanne, raising eight children whose descendants became voyageurs, nuns, and interpreters. He died between 1678 and 1681 in Sillery (no burial record), with Jeanne following in 1689; a 2005 monument honors them on his original land.";
