export const michaelFranksSrStory = "Michael Franks Sr., born January 16, 1725, in Alsace-Lorraine, Germany, married Mary Miller in 1742 and emigrated to America around 1761, settling in German Township, Fayette County, PA, where he and relatives obtained a 117-acre warrant called 'Straight Narrow Way' in 1785 for a Lutheran church, patented in 1794 after building a log 'Dutch Meeting House.' Of French-German descent tracing to Franconia tribes, his 1792 will divided his plantation equally among sons Michael and Jacob plus daughter Catherine Bacus (with extra shillings to Michael), reflecting family ties in a frontier beset by Indian threats and forts. He died March 25, 1793, amid a lineage that intermarried with local settlers like Browns and Walsers.";
