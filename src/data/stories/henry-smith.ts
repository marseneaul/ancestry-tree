// // Henry SMITH served under Capt. Samuel Paxton's Ranging Company of Bedford County, and under Capt. James McKinney's Company of the 1st Battalion of Bedford County, 1783 during the American Revolutionary War. His biography states that he was a "Minute Man", Scout, Militia member, and an Indian trader. (Records from the Daughters of the American Revolution.)

// This section of Pennsylvania was Bedford County until 1773 then Westmoreland County until 1783 when Fayette County was formed and was also claimed by Virginia.

//  "Of Henry SMITH for his pay as one of the New Levies for 18 months in the Federal Army in the year 1780 amounting to forty-five pounds." (Penna. Archives - Series 6 - Vol. 4 - P. 8 - Wed. March 23 1791)

// Henry's will is in the Fayette County Courthouse, Uniontown, PA; book of wills # 2 page 111.The will states that Henry left to his sons from his first wife, one dollar and a horse. He split his property equally between his two sons from his second wife, Solomon and Daniel. To his second wife, Margaret, he left the stove, the stove room and one third of his estate.


// My grandfather, Henry Smith, when he was about 17 years old, left the parental roof of his father's house somewhere on Antietam Creek, near Sharpsburg, Md., sometime in the last half of the eighteenth century, and took his way west as an emigrant. into what is known as Georges Township, Fayette Co., Pa. he found his way to the head waters of Black Run and took up a claim by Tommyhawk Right of a tract of land owned lately by a W. S. Kyle. My grandfather said when he took up this claim that he could track a bear all day where he made his path through the wild pea vines, indicating very rich soil. Henry Smith never took out a patent on this tract of land because he sent word back to that his old home, to his father's house on Antietam Creek, Md., he, Henry Smith, had found the Eldorado of the New World, and for all of them to come on and take up land. So my great grandpap, Philip Smith, with bag and baggage, came to what is now Georges Township, Fayette Co., Pa., about the year 1750, if my memory serves me right, and he, and Henry Smith, his son, and my grandfather made a trade for this tract of land formally tommyhawked out by Henry Smith and Philip Smith. Henry Smith's father became the owner of the W. S. Kyle tract of land, then at that time containing about four hundred acres. It was right in the wilderness, primeval forest of oaks, walnuts, and poplars and nearly all underlaid with the nine-foot vein of bituminous coal worth at least four thousand dollars per acre today. Now, if a person had it as it then was the timber or the coal would be a fortune. So it is, our forbears knew not the worth of their lands.
// A few words about Philip Smith, my great grandpap. He came to this country from Europe, GE/I think. He was quite a musician and played the violin fairly well. He had been a captain in the Helladamy. After he came to America he was in great demand at the country dances. He loved the dances and he fiddled until he fiddled his big tract of land away, and I think he died a poor man. Grandfather Henry Smith had a brother called Felty Smith. He was a soldier. He went with Colonel Crawford on his ill-fated expedition against the Indians of what was then called the north- west, consisting of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. Col. Crawford met the Indians in Ohio at a place called Pickaway Plains and suffered an awful defeat, the most of his command being cruelly tommyhawked and scalped. Col. Crawford himself was captured and slowly roasted to death. Unele Felty Smith was in that fight with the Indians, but with a comrade made his escape by breaking through the Indian ranks with clubbed-rifle, and after many hardships ar- rived at their starting point, now the city of Wheeling, W. Va.
// Well, the Smith family or their forbears were in a good many Indian fights. Henry Smith hunted and fought with the Poes, Whet- zels, and Bradys.
// The history of the Smith family ahead of my grandfather id rather dim. Henry Smith, after selling his claim to Philip Smith, his father, came down Black Run and tommyhawked out a cliam on York's run of about 300 acres and went tomimproving it. About this time he joined the Continental army and fought against the British for our Independence. He was twice married. The name of his first wife I do not have. His second wife was a widow Stowe. By her he had four children, Solomon, Daniel, Susannah, and Eliz- abeth. His last claim on York's Run he improved after his army service, I think. He built a large log house, still standing, and a large log barn--it has gone long ago. D. Stanley Smith, a great grandson owned the Henry Smith old homestead until recently when he sold it to ta a Mr. Breakiron. So none of Henry Smith's land that he claimed by tommyhawk right is now in possession of any of his offspring. Solomon Smith, oldest son of Henry Smith by his second wife, the widow Stowe, was twice married. His first wife was Mary Roder- ick. They had two children, Jonathan and Margaret. By his second wife, Polly Hayden, they had four children, Elizabeth, Kiziah, Albert, and Mary. Daniel Smith, the second son by his second wife married Elizabeth Roderick. They had eight children, Henry, Louisa, Lydia, David, Samuel, Orlando, A. J., and D. P. We are scattered over the country. My aunt's families I cannot give. I may have omitted some, not intentionally but through ignorance. So here I will close. This is the best I can do

export const henrySmithStory = "Henry Smith Sr., born around 1752 in Maryland, migrated west as a teen, claiming land by tomahawk right in Pennsylvania's wilderness (then Bedford/Westmoreland County, disputed by Virginia), where he served as an Indian spy, scout, and Minute Man in the Revolutionary War under Captains Samuel Paxton and James McKinney in Eighth Pennsylvania Regiment as a Sergeant. A skilled hunter who fought alongside frontiersmen like the Poes, Whetzels, and Bradys, he received a pension starting in 1831 at age 81, and his family endured Indian conflictsâ€”including brother Felty's escape from Colonel Crawford's disastrous 1782 expedition. Twice married, Henry raised children who scattered across the country, while his violin-loving father, Philip, traded for his son's rich coal-laden claim but fiddled away his fortunes at country dances, dying poor.";
