// She was one of the King's Daughters and founding Mothers, 1663-1673

// Notes for Elisabeth Prevost/Provost:
// "King's Daughters", page 469, Elisabeth Prevost was born about 1646 in the parish of Saint-Nicolas in Rouen, Normandie, the daughter of master tailor Adrien Prévost and Marie Leblond. After losing her father and watching sister Marguerite leave as a Fille du Roi in 1669, Elisabeth left for Canada in 1671 at about age 25, taking with her goods worth an estimated 300 livres for her dowry. A value of about $4,275 in the USA in the year 2000.
// On 14 November 1671, Elisabeth married Jean-François Foucault at Québec City and was given the King's Gift of 50 livres (this was about what an unskilled man was paid for a year's work). She signed the marriage contract drawn up 08 November by notary Becquet, but her husband could not.
// Elisabeth Prévost was buried 04 January 1722 at Trois Rivières.

export const mariePrevostStory = "Elisabeth Prévost, born around 1646 in Rouen, Normandie, to tailor Adrien Prévost and Marie Leblond, became a Fille du Roi (or King's Daughter) after her father's death, following sister Marguerite to Canada in 1671 with a 300-livre dowry and receiving the King's 50-livre gift upon marrying Jean-François Foucault in Québec City. Literate enough to sign her marriage contract (unlike her husband), she helped populate New France as a founding mother. She died in 1722 at Trois-Rivières.";
