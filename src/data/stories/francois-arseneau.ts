export const francoisArseneauStory = "François L’Archeveque dit Arseneau, born around 1625 in France (likely La Rochelle), migrated to New France by 1665 as a farmer leasing land in Cap-de-la-Madeleine, where he married Suzanne Lecomte and fathered son Michel amid the colony's harsh pioneering days. Tragically, Suzanne died in childbirth in December 1666, and François succumbed to a 'flux of blood' just over two years later on February 10, 1669, leaving young Michel in guardianship. As one of Quebec's early French settlers, he became the progenitor of numerous Arsenault descendants across Canada, with surname variations like Arçonneau reflecting the era's fluid spellings.";
