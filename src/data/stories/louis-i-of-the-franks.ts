export const louisIOfTheFranksStory = "Louis I \"the Pious,\" born around 778 in Aquitaine as Charlemagne's son, was appointed King of Aquitaine at age three and crowned co-emperor in 813, inheriting the Frankish Empire in 814 where he pursued religious reforms and the Carolingian Renaissance amid Viking threats and rebellions. His divisive succession plans—splitting the realm among sons from two marriages—ignited civil wars from 830, resulting in his brief deposition and restoration. A devout but indecisive ruler, he died in 840 near Ingelheim, his fractured empire leading to the 843 Treaty of Verdun that divided it into three kingdoms.";
