export const louisArseneauStory = "Louis Arseneau, born August 28, 1769, in Louiseville, Quebec, lived through Quebec's turbulent early 19th-century era as a French-Canadian settler, marrying Marie Victoria Damphouse in 1791 amid post-Conquest transitions before her 1804 death. Widowed, he remarried Marguerite Paille in 1805, raising a family in rural Maskinongé until dying at 79 on August 10, 1849, in St-Stanislas-de-Champlain—a testament to enduring Acadian-rooted resilience in New France descendants.";
