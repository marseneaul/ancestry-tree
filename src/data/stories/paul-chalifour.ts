export const paulChalifourStory = "Paul Chalifour, born December 26, 1612, in Périgny, France, renounced Protestantism to marry Marie Jeannet in 1644 but was mysteriously imprisoned in 1647 over a mint-related money dispute, emigrating to New France shortly after release to start anew as a master builder specializing in frameworks for houses, barns, windmills, and cellars. Amid frontier perils, he dabbled in eel fishing and farming on Île d'Orléans while pioneering North America's first health insurance contract in 1655. Widowed young, he married 16-year-old Jacquette Archambault in 1648, fathering 14 children (seven daughters married by 17), and died October 13, 1680, in Quebec City—ancestor to celebrities like Jack Kerouac, Jim Carrey, and Dan Aykroyd.";
