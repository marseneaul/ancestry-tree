Cox, born July 27, 1860, in Canada to John Cox Sr. and Ellen Duffy, married Huldah Franks in 1880 in Ionia, MI, before settling in Onaway in 1898 when it had just 28 residents, becoming its first barber and launching the successful Hotel Greenwood in 1899 with son Allen—a welcoming $1.50–$2.00/day hostelry with sample rooms and a well-stocked bar that boosted the growing town.
