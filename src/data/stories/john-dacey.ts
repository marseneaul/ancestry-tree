FOUND DROWNED - About 11 o'clock yesterday formoon the upper slip of the Detroid dry-dock was being pumped out in order to make some repairs to a vessel which was in the slip. As the water neared the bottom of the slip, the body of a man, lying on its face, with a stick of wood lying upon one arm, was discovered. Officer John Dacey was called, and taking charge of the body, notified Coroner Schulte, who selected a jury, and after viewing the body, turned it over to undertaker Geist. The body was recognized as that of Daniel Sloan, a laboring man, who has been missing from his boarding-house, near the corner of Franklin street and St. Aubin avenue since last Tuesday. The inquest will be concluded Wednesday.
John Dacey, for 31 years a member of the Detroit police department, died early yesterday afternoon at his home, 265 Porter street, following a sudden physical collapse which is thought to have resulted from a blood clot on the brain, caused by an automobile accident about two weeks ago. Badly bruised and shaken up when he was knocked down by an automobile, the aged man showed no evidences of serious injury until last Friday, when he lapsed into a comatose condition. He failed to regain consciousness. Dacey received his honerable discharge from the police department February 28, 1906. He was enrolled on the force June 30, 1875, and last served as doorman of the Scotten avenue station. Prior to his police service, Dacey served as watchman in the old county jail, under Sheriff George C. Codd, now dead. He was the hero of a frustrated jail delivery, preventing the escape of a number of desperate prisoners who had tunneled their way almost to liberty. His suspicions aroused by the unwonted quiet in the cells, Dacey lay in concealment close to a cell block all one night listening to mysterious noises, which finally disclosed the plot. The prisoners had made their way out of their cells and into the jail garret when they were found by the deputies. Dacey leaves one son, George P. Dacey, and two daughters, Mrs. James Markey and Mrs. Ellen Skane.
DACEY - October 27, at his residence, 265 Porter street, Policeman John Dacey, beloved husband of the late Anna Dacey and father of Mrs. James Markey, Mrs. Ellen Skane, and George P. Dacey. Funeral Friday from residence at 3:30, and Holy Trinity church at 9 o'clock.

He also handled the grim discovery of drowned laborer Daniel Sloan's body in a dry-dock while on duty. Dacey passed away (post-retirement) from a blood clot in the brain caused by an automobile accident two weeks prior, leaving behind a son and two daughters."
