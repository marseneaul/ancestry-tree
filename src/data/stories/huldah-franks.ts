export const huldahFranksStory = "Huldah Franks, born November 1864 in Ohio, married Canadian immigrant James D. Cox in 1880 in Ionia, MI, before relocating to tiny Onaway in 1898, where they built and operated the beloved Hotel Greenwoodâ€”a central social hub with sample rooms and a bar amid the town's rapid lumber-driven growth. Mother to at least son Allen (who co-managed until his early 1906 death), she was widowed in 1923 and remarried James H. Umphrey at age 60 in 1925, passing away February 19, 1931, in Onaway after a resilient life on Michigan's frontier.";
