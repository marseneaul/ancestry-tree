C. A. Diebel, 60 of Columbus, and well known in Lancaster was killed Friday afternoon on the National pike, when his auto went into the ditch and overturned. He was accompanied by John Eberie, 22, also of Columbus, who managed to crawl from under the car without serious injury. Eberie was taking Deibel to the property of the Jupiter Oil and Gas Co., of which both were officers, when the machine skidded and fell into a ditch pinning Deibel on a pile of boulders. Passing motorists took both to Hebron and then to Columbus. Deibel was a director of the company, vice president of the Franklin Loan and Savings Co., president of the Dodern Tool, Die and Machine Co., director of the Krupp Shoe Co., director of the Produce Exchange Bank, and a director and former treasurer of the Franklin Brewing Co. His widow, four sons, Joseph, Louis, Walter, and Carl, all of Columbus; two daughters, Miss Irene at home, and Mrs. Floyd Scott of Columbus, survive.
DEIBEL, Charles A., HEAD OF VARIOUS ACTIVITIES The life story of the late Charles A. Deibel, of Columbus, Ohio, is that of an ambitious boy who earned everything which he possessed, even his education, and from boyhood knew the value of money as only the self-made can know. Mr. Deibel from boyhood was obliged to rely upon himself, and that training developed a man strong and self-reliant, resourceful and always keenly alive to the importance of quick decision and prompt action. He never temporized, but if his judgment approved he quickly acted. Charles A. Deibel was born in Columbus, Ohio, July 7, 1860, and died there September 24, 1920. He was a son of Caspar and Crezentia (Volk) Deibel, his father a stonecutter by trade. Charles A. Deibel was educated in Holy Cross Parochial School, and being one of a family of nine, his parents could not assist him to further his education. He was ambitious to obtain business college training, and in order to finance the cause established a paper route, which he carried on all through his business college attendance, paying the entire expense of the course himself. After graduation he sold his paper route and obtained a position in the Columbus Union Railroad Station. With his mother's assistance he and his brother bought a small grocery store. That store, located on South High Street, Columbus, was a prosperous enterprise, and they added another store, located on Third Street, but later Charles Deibel sold out his interest in the South High Street store to his brother, and devoted his interest to the store on Third Street. That store also he sold to his brothers and retired from the grocery line to purchase the Columbus Hat & Furnishings Company. As that business prospered, he added a shoe store to his activities, opening on South High Street. He was now well established in business, having two prosperous stores, and with success had come honorable reputation and the esteem of his fellowmen. After deciding upon the value of a good loan association both as an investment and to a community, he aided in the organization of the Franklin Loan Association, and until his passing was a director of that institution. He was also an organizer of the Franklin Brewing Company and until within six months of his death he served that corporation as treasurer. He then resigned, his private affairs becoming too burdensome to carry comfortably. He had acquired many interests during his many years of active business life, among them being the Modern Die, Tool & Machine Company, of which he was founder and president; the Jupiter Oil Company, of which he was vice-president and organizer; the Produce Bank, which he served as director. These were all prosperous enterprises, and all were important in their own distinct fields. Mr. Deibel was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks; Knights of St. John; Catholic Order of Foresters; Camp Darby Fishing and Hunting Club; Olenatyang Club; and the Buckeye Republican Club. Mr. Deibel married, in 1885, Mary Merk, of Columbus, Ohio, daughter of Valentine Merk, a prominent business man of Columbus. Six children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Deibel: Louis F., in the insurance business; Walter J., a photographer; Marie, married F. Scott, of Columbus, Ohio; Joseph F., with the Modern Die Tool & Machine Company; Carl E., Also with the foregoing company; Irene, residing with her mother at the family home in Columbus.
