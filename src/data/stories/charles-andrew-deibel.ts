C.A. Diebel, 60 of Columbus, and well known in Lancaster was killed Friday afternoon on the National pike, when his auto went into the ditch and overturned. He was accompanied by John Eberie, 22, also of Columbus, who managed to crawl from under the car without serious injury. Eberie was taking Deibel to the property of the Jupiter Oil and Gas Co., of which both were officers, when the machine skidded and fell into a ditch pinning Deibel on a pile of boulders. Passing motorists took both to Hebron and then to Columbus. Deibel was a director of the company, vice president of the Franklin Loan and Savings Co., president of the Dodern Tool, Die and Machine Co., director of the Krupp Shoe Co., director of the Produce Exchange Bank, and a director and former treasurer of the Franklin Brewing Co. His widow, four sons, Joseph, Louis, Walter, and Carl, all of Columbus; two daughters, Miss Irene at home, and Mrs. Floyd Scott of Columbus, survive.
