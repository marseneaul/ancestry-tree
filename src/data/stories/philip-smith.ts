// So my great grand pap, Philip smith, with baggage and bag, came to what is now george's township, fayette co. Pennsylvannia, about the year 1750, and he, and his son Henry smith, made a trade for this land formally tommahawked out by Philip Smith and Henry Smith. He became the owner of the W. S. Kyle tract of land, then at that time containing about 400 acres. It was right in the wilderness, primevil forest of oaks, walnuts, and poplars and nearly all underlaid with the nine-foot vein of bituminous coal worth at least 4000 dollars per acre today. Our forebearers knew not the value of their land.  A few words about Philip Smith, my great grandpap. He came to this country from Europe, Germany I think. He was quite the musician and played the violin fairly well. He had been a captain in the German army. After he came to america he was in great demand at the country dances. He loved the dances and he fiddled until he fiddled his big tract of land away, and I think he died a poor man.
// Phillip Schmit, (Smith) was born ni Cologne, Germany about 1725. He was a Captain ni the German Army and called Captain Shamoka. He was discharged ni 1750.
He married Barbara Markley. They came to America and settled in Antietem Creek, Maryland. (It was on this farm that the Battle of Antietem was fought in the Civil War in 1862, 12 years after Captain Smith settled there).
Adescendent of Phillip Smith, acousin of David Davis Smith, fought ni this
battle on the Union Side, Vis. A.J. Smith. It was after this battle and its results that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves.
To this marriage was born Henry Smith ni 1752. I do not know if any other children were born.
