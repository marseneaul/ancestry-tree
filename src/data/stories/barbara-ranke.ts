export const barbaraRankeStory = "Barbara C.G. Ranke, born January 20, 1864, in Frankenmuth, MI—one of 13 children to German immigrant parents Christian Friedrich Ranke and Margaretha Zehnder—married Frederich David Moser in 1885, blending her Bavarian heritage with his 1883 immigration from Germany. By 1910, the couple owned a debt-free farm along Reese Road in Denmark Township, Tuscola County, where David worked as a naturalized farmer, raising a family in Michigan's tight-knit German communities. She outlived him by eight years, passing away at 89 on November 14, 1953, back in Frankenmuth.";
