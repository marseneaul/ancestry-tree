export const pierrePaulArseneaultStory = "Pierre Paul 'Joseph' Arsenault, born around 1710 possibly in Montréal, served as miller for the Ursuline nuns of Trois-Rivières, securing a contested land grant from them in 1737 amid litigation with prior heirs that he resolved by paying 200 livres to uphold the transfer. Literate enough to sign his name—boosting his social standing in the parish hierarchy—he married three times amid New France's challenges, including to Marie-Anne Brissard dite St Germain (likely Josette Grisard) in 1744 at Maskinongé, fathering children before dying at 75 on January 18, 1785, in Rivière-du-Loup.";
